# **All worked up**

You got yourself

All worked up and no way out

Feel it like a disease

If I could get ahold of myself

I could break free

I could break free...

----------------------------------

Don't settle for

Light is burning all the midnight oil

They can't take it from me

Set it up, dust it off

It's only your broken heart

They can't break it for me

They can't break me...

-----------------------------------

There's nothing to see

I'm already leaving

Just be at ease

I see no reason

Get to face your fear

With your finger pointed at me, both directions

Belong and all you've ever done

Is standing in the mirror what have you have to fear.

Is me, now I'm taking over

------------------------------------

Standing on

The only side of the line that you can see

There's times in life

There's only one right there can be

Your soul can take it now

So don't forget it...how

You bet your life and you bleed

Sinking in your teeth

You taste that foul disease

And I'm gone

And I'm free
